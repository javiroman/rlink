- We created the round robin database called: test.rrd 
- Which starts at 7th of March, 1999 (this date translates to 920804400 seconds):

	RRDtool works with special time stamps coming from the UNIX world.
	This time stamp is the number of seconds that passed since January 1st
	1970 UTC. The time stamp value is translated into local time and it
	will therefore look different for different time zones.

- Our database holds one data source (DS) named "speed" that represents a counter.

- This counter is read every five minutes (this is the default therefore you don't have to put --step=300)

- In the same database two round robin archives (RRAs) are kept:

	RRA one averages the data every time it is read (e.g., there's nothing to average) 
	and keeps 24 samples (24 times 5 minutes is 2 hours). 

	RRA other averages 6 values (half hour) and contains 10 such averages (e.g. 5 hours).
